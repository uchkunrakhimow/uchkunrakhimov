Hiring decisions are hard when teams rely on gut feel. HRCS Yaponamama makes candidate assessment structured and fair. It guides candidates through a standardized personality test, tracks progress, and generates clear, professional reports for hiring managers.

What I did

- Designed a multi‑tenant system with roles so multiple companies can work safely in one platform
- Built the testing engine, secure links for candidates, and real‑time progress tracking
- Automated report generation to turn raw answers into readable insights

Impact

- Faster screening for recruiters and less bias in decisions
- Clear reports that help teams align on fit without long debriefs
- Reliable operations across languages (RU/UZ) for a broader hiring pool

Highlights

- Candidate profiles, assignments, and history in one place
- Psychological scoring with structured PDF reports
- Secure sessions, validation, and audit‑friendly data handling

Tech at a glance: Bun + TypeScript on the back end (Elysia.js, PostgreSQL/Prisma), React on the front end, Dockerized for consistent deployments.
