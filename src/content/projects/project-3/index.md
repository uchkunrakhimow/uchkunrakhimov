Operations teams move fast, but information often doesn’t. Tedbook CRM pulls sales, logistics, warehouse, and accounting into one real‑time workflow so orders don’t get stuck and teams stay in sync.

What I did

- Built the order lifecycle end to end with clear roles for every team
- Added real‑time comments inside each order so context never lives in chat apps
- Designed dashboards, exports, and stock flows that match how ops really work

Impact

- Faster handoffs between teams and fewer delivery mistakes
- Immediate visibility into order status and stock levels
- Lower support noise thanks to in‑app collaboration

Highlights

- Orders, products, stock, payments, locations-managed in one place
- Role‑based access for admin, operator, logistician, courier, warehouse, and accounting
- Real‑time updates and exports for day‑to‑day operations

Tech at a glance: TypeScript with Node/Express and MongoDB on the back end, React on the front end, Socket.IO for realtime, Docker + Nginx for deployment.
