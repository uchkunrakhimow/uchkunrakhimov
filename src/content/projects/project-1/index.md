FETG.uz is a service hub for businesses that need modern IT without the heavy lift—cloud telephony, DevOps automation, and infrastructure management in one place. Many small and mid-sized teams were juggling vendors and tools; I built a platform that brings the essentials together with a clean, reliable experience.

What I did

- Led the end‑to‑end build: architecture, API, and UI with a modular monorepo
- Implemented secure, production‑ready services (rate limits, CORS, Helmet) and error handling
- Set up containerized deployment behind Nginx for simple, repeatable releases

Impact

- Faster onboarding for new clients and a single pane of glass for their IT needs
- Call analytics and email workflows that reduce manual follow‑ups
- A responsive, accessible UI that works well on any device

Highlights

- Cloud telephony with call center features and actionable analytics
- DevOps automation from CI to deployment with predictable configurations
- Managed infrastructure patterns that are easy to support and scale

Tech at a glance: TypeScript across the stack, React on the front end, Node/Express on the back end, Docker + Nginx for delivery.
