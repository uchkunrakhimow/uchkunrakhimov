Contributing to the PillPlan project by maintaining and improving the backend, fixing bugs, delivering new features, and optimizing performance and scalability. The system is built with **NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB (via Prisma)** and runs on **Google Cloud Platform**.

Key contributions:

- Implemented **VoIP call reminders** via **APNs**, using **Cloud Tasks** and **Cloud Scheduler** to trigger calls when a user misses their medication (e.g., initiating a call 5 minutes after a missed dose).
- Built and integrated the **Family feature**, enabling shared access and management of medication plans.
- Improved overall backend stability and scalability through ongoing maintenance and optimization.
